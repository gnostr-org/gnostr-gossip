# Gossip Relay Picker

This is the code that the gossip client uses to pick relays to connect to and
assign public keys to each.

If you try to use this library and find it difficult due to `async` issues implementing the hooks, let me know. We can make more of the hooks `async`. I know how much of a PITA it can be.
